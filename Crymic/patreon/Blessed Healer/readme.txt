Here's a macro for your clerics using Damage Bonus for Midi-QoL for Blessed Healer.

Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.
