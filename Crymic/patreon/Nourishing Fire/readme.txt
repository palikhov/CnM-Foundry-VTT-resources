First create a feature called "Nourishing Fire" and enter its description only

Starting at 14th level, your fire spells soothe and restore you. When you expend a spell slot to cast a spell that includes a fire damage roll, you regain hit points equal to the slotâ€™s level + your Charisma modifier.
This macro will fire if there is damage dealt, place it only on spells that deal fire damage.

This one runs as "on use" within midi-qol. For basic steps check out the pinned post, it has a walk through video.
