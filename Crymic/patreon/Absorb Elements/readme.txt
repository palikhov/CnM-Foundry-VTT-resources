Hey guys,

This macro is a mix of Midi-qol and DAE. After being attacked the player can cast this spell, if they were indeed the target of one of the correct elements. The macro will apply the damage and resistance until their next attack or until the turn ends as per raw.

Damage must be completed before this macro can fire.

The spell captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type, and the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
