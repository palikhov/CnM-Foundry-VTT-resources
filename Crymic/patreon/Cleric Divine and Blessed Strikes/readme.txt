Here are 2 versions for your happy 8th level Clerics in your campaign.

Divine Strike

8th-level Order Domain feature
You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
Blessed Strikes

8th-level cleric feature, which replaces the Divine Strike or Potent Spellcasting feature
You are blessed with divine might in battle. When a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can also deal 1d8 radiant damage to that creature. Once you deal this damage, you canâ€™t use this feature again until the start of your next turn.
