Ok here's a macro for you mages out there. So Expert Divination is this.

Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can't be higher than 5th level.
The macro will now prompt you with a box asking which spell slot to restore. Inject this macro on use it any Divination spell your mage will cast.
