I recently discovered you get a lot of chat data by filtering through "ChatMessage.collection._source" or you can even use "game.messages" in the Foundry console.

By using this method and having midi-qol, you can actually grab flag details on the attack or even grab roll check data. Pretty huge for say if you want to see what the last weapon used, then check if you criticaled or not.

I've been using this method lately with my Sneak Attack 2.0 macro as well as my macro for Green Flame Blade.
