Unity Domain Clerics rejoice!

Starting at 1st level, you can forge an empowering bond between allies. As an action, you can choose two willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself) and create a magical bond between them. While either bonded creature is within 30 feet of the other, the creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature can add the d4 no more than once per turn. The bond lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again.
This macro is used via DAE and allows you cast it on your favored targets. Every combat turn, they will get a 1d4 die which they will automatically use on their first roll.
