One of my players decided to pick up this feature, so you guys get my macro for it.

Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit points maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.
This macro one runs via DamageBonus with Midi-qol in combat. It will automatically detect the targets hp and deal extra damage. Then place a marker on the player showing they used it. After the next turn in combat, it will automatically go away, allowing the player to use the ability again.
