Hey automation lovers! My long teased Blood Hunter macros are here. With this release I have 3 macros lined up and more to come. The following macros I showing off in this video are.

Crimson Rite
Blood Curse of Bloated Agony
Blood Curse of the Marked
Set 2 will feature:

Brand of Castigation, with Brand of Tethering Support
Blood Curse of Binding
Blood Curse of the Muddled Mind
Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet
Blood Curse of Exposure
Set 3 will feature

Blood Curse of the Exorcist
Blood Curse of the Howl
Blood Curse of Corrosion
Blood Curse of the Souleater
Blood Curse of the Anxious is just a simple DAE icon, since there is no way attack via Skill Rolls.

Blood Curse of the Eyeless will need further thought.
