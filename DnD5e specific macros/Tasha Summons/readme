All macros require: Item Macro, the Furnace.

step 1: get all the scripts and json files of the spell you want to use.

step 2: import the json files into your game.

step 3: check if the item macro is correctly on the item, if not paste the item macro there.

step 4: create the gm macro, make sure to run it as GM, and name it summonSpiritFey or summonSpiritElemental or summonSpiritBeast
if you choose another name for it, make sure to correct the item macro.

Final step: place the image file (i have no rights to the images, so dont use commercially) 
in your foundry data path, and fix the gm macro to have the right location.
Or make your own.
